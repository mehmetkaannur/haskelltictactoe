When ran via `cabal run`, Haskell will "buffer" the input and output streams
for performance. This is annoying, since it means that some printing can happen
out-of-order -- the strings are only written when a newline is entered!

There are a few ways of getting around this, like using `hFlush stdout` after
each print. However, in this case, it is simplest to just disable the buffering
altogether. This function *must* be called at the start of your `main` function.
